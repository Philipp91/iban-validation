## Installation

To install jschaedl/iban-validation via composer use

```sh
$ composer require jschaedl/iban-validation
```

## Usage example

```php
<?php

use Iban\Validation\Validator;
use Iban\Validation\Iban;

$iban = new Iban('DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00');
$validator = new Validator();

$isValid = $validator->validate($iban);
         
if (!$isValid) {
    foreach ($validator->getViolations() as $violation) {
        echo $violation;
    }
}

```

You can also customize the violation messages by providing them via configuration. Just create a `Validator` passing a config array as constructor argument.

```php
<?php

use Iban\Validation\Validator;

$validator = new Validator([
    'violation.invalid_length' => 'The length of the given Iban is too short!',
    'violation.invalid_locale_code' => 'The locale code of the given Iban is not valid!',
    'violation.invalid_format' => 'The format of the given Iban is not valid!',
    'violation.invalid_checksum' => 'The checksum of the given Iban is not valid!',
]);

```
